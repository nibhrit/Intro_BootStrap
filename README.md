### Intro to what BootStrap is all about

- It is a front end library. Involves what the user actually sees more than the functionality(backend).
- Reusable. Designing becomes easier. It was developed by Twitter. It makes sites responsive to the viewport. Adaptable layout
- Pre-styled elements can be dropped into our projects. We won't need things like css button generators etc. No need for so much css code to be written. Classes are available with bootstrap. Like "btn-primary", "btn-dark", "btn-outline-dark", "btn-large". Jumbotron. For designs, go to product, or download the examples.
- To install it just take CDN from official site and include in index.html below the title. CDN - Content Delivery Network. CDN helps us host our site at various places to reduce the latency. We can also use the starter template.
- Wireframing  - low level design. Maybe using pencil. Like a blueprint. Opposite is a mockup. High fidelity outline. Represent the site in action. Consult links like ui-patterns.com, dribble.com.
- Wireframes can be created using sneakpeekit.com, balsamiq.cloud

- Collapse button and dropdown menu working fine in codeply but not in vscode. Probably additional things are to be included for local machine(some js files maybe).
- Added the jQuery and bootstrap js scripts and now everything is working
